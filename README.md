Truth (Oxford Readings in Philosophy) [1]
-----------------------------------------

### Details

This volume is designed to set out some of the central issues in the
theory of truth. It draws together, for the first time, the debates
between philosophers who favor ‘robust’ or ‘substantive’ theories of
truth, and those other, ‘deflationist’ or minimalists, who deny that
such theories can be given. The editors provide a substantial
introduction, in which they look at how the debates relate to further
issues, such as the Liar paradox and formal truth theories. This volume
contains classic readings by authors such as William James, Bertrand
Russell, Gottlob Frege, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Alfred Tarski, Quine, Peter
Strawson, J.L. Austin, Paul Horwich, Michael Dummett, Donald Davidson,
Anil Gupta and Richard Rorty to name a few. I think it is fair to say
that most, if not all significant theories of truth advanced in the 20th
century are covered in this volume.
